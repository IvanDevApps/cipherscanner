## About the Cipher Scanner

CipherScanner is a GUI for [SaltwaterTaffy](https://github.com/thomdixon/SaltwaterTaffy) Nmap wrapper library.
Idea of CipherScanner is to make Nmap scanning as simple as possible to users that do not want to spend much time configuring their settings.

What is the difference between Zenmap/Nmap and Cipher Scanner?
* Zenmap/Nmap is very confusing and hard to understand for beginners, and if someone wants to scan a target quickly with strong scan settings they will not be able to do it without some research or knowledge.
* CipherScanner has two options for the user, automatic settings or manual settings. If user does not have any knowledge and does not want to spend time learning and wants the best results quickly, he can use automatic settings and everything will be ready for the user.

Of course, Zenmap/Nmap also has some automatic options/profiles, but they are still hard to understand and they lack some settings(e.g. wide port range and similar).

Note - This is my first project on GitHub and since I'm still learning C# expect some newbie mistakes and bugs.
